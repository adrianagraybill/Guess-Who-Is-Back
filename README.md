# Guess-Who-Is-Back
Getting back into coding.

5/24/22 - Coding Journal

My first commit in years. Let's see how much comes back to me.

Today my goal was to set up my coding environment on my new macbook and get a first commit.

I am finally at a place where I am mentally strong enough and ready to get back into coding. As I look back on these past couple years, the person I am today is so much better off in every way. I'm excited to see what I can accomplish now that I have a better sense of who I am and can empower myself. I can do this. I want to do this. I owe it to myself.
